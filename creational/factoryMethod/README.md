`Main Idea : ` 
    if multiple classes with all public methods to be common, then you have interface and interface factory to get new instance and work with only inteface type.

`Use cases:`
1. GUI libraries where every component has different implementation for each platform like Linux, Windows, Mac,...
2. Database connections like MySql, Postgress,....
3. Payments-systems in E-commerce for different payment types like Debit, Credit, UPI,... 
    Actually , we get SDK library from paytm, phonepe,....
    It is usually implemented by library we get interface type.
